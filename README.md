# cmake-examples

Shareable examples and notes that document how I use CMake for projects and
customize its features. These are opinionated examples written by a
**Windows-native** user using **VS Code** for CMake projects.

The [core/](core/) folder contains the most minimal and basic setups while
[extras/](extras/) documents niche configurations that are a little more
specific to my environment or use-case.
